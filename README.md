# Introduction

POSH is a micro-language for writing POS (Parts of Speach) Rules. 

Example Hello World:

	SENT: NN(hello) & NN(world) = true

This will parse the sentence:

	hello world!
	
This would return: true

Reserved key words:

* SENT
* PARA
* true
* false

## Definition

BNF (Backusâ€“Naur Form) grammar notation.

	 <posh-rule> ::= <scope>: <exprs> = <returns> <EOL>
	 <exprs>     ::= <exper> | <exper> <oper> <exper>
	 <exper>     ::= <class>(<word>)
	 <oper>      ::= '&' | '|'
	 <scope>     ::= 'SENT' | 'PARA' | 'SECTION' | 'DOC'
	 <word>      ::=  {word} ['+' <hyper>] ['-' <hypo>]
	 <returns>   ::= {return} | {return}, {return}
	 <return>    ::= 'matchs' | 'true' | 'false' | {float} | {int}  
	 <flags>     ::= [<flag>, <flag>] or <flag>
	 <flag>      ::= {flag}

* posh-rule: a complete rule
* scope: 
	* SENT: look in the scope of each sentence. All enclosed conditions must be true
	* PARA: Look in the scope of a paragraph

	* DOC: look in the schope of all given text for that subject
* exprs: abstract 'Expression' contaiing one 'exper' (expression), or a chain held together with oper (operator)
* class: The word class provided by user given taxonomy
* word: the string that represents the word
	* hyper: the max distance above in a parse tree
	* hypo: the max distance below in a parse tree 
* oper: operator that sits between expressions for truth checking
* return: what to reply back to caller with if all cases are true
	* 'true' or 'false' returns booleans
	* matchs *see match return format[^1]*
* flags: comma list of flags [platform independent]for the handler. For example:
	* 'i' could mean case*i*nsensative
